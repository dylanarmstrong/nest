## Nest
Reading and writing to my nest thermostat. Temperature is in F.

### Setup
Copy config.example.json to config.json and include your client token and device id. The [Nest API](https://developers.nest.com/guides/api/thermostat-guide) docs are pretty good about all the information you could possibly want for this.

### Use
read temperature: `nest`

set temperature: `nest 73`
